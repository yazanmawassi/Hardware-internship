 Project Description: Simulation of Digital Circuits using VHDL

In this project, we focus on the modeling, simulation, and synthesis of digital circuits using the hardware description language VHDL. The goal is to understand and practically apply the complete design and simulation process of a digital system — from functional modeling to structural implementation.

Project Goals
The main objective is to realistically model the behavior of digital circuits and verify their functionality through simulation. Using VHDL, we aim to:

1- Describe basic logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, NAND) behaviorally and structurally

2- Build more complex components such as multiplexers, decoders, and flip-flops

3- Understand and apply different abstraction levels (behavioral, structural, dataflow)

4- Correctly model concurrent and sequential processes

5- Simulate signal behavior over time using GHDL and GTKWave

6- Experience the connection between description, simulation, and synthesis through hands-on tasks


 Content Overview

1- Introduction to VHDL syntax and structure

2- Circuit modeling using Entity & Architecture

3- Behavioral and structural modeling of basic gates

4- Concurrent and sequential process modeling

5- Signal simulation and waveform analysis

6- Creating and using testbenches for validation

7- Assertion-based debugging and error tracing

8- Building complex digital components (e.g., ALUs, FSMs)


 Why it Matters

Understanding VHDL is essential in digital hardware design — especially in the development of FPGAs, ASICs, and embedded systems. Through practical exercises and realistic examples, we learn how digital systems are not just theoretically designed, but technically implemented and verified through simulation.
